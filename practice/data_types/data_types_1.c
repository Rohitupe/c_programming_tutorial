// datatyapes of c part 1
// datatypes are very very important

/*
1) primitive datatype = smallest data type => measn they cannot be broken into pieces
                      = indivisible/atomic
                      = building blocks

2) complex datatype = struct >> eg:- date today;
                                     coordinates 101;
                                     for making link list coordinates;
