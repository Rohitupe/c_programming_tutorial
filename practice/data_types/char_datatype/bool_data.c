int main(){
    _Bool codeingIsEasy = 0; // IF value assign to variable is 0 it means False
    // _Bool codingIsEasy = 1232; // Anything greater than 0 means True
    printf("To check whether the bool is right or wrong 1=Right, 0=Wrong So the answer is == %i\n",codeingIsEasy);

    return 0;
}

/* Explanation
in the above code to use boolean we use _Bool
for false we use 0
and for true we can use any positive number rather than 0
the value for tru and false is shown by in integer so we are printing the integer in the print statement
*/

// 1 is True ,, 0 is False
